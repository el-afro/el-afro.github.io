# Visualizing Counter Strike Esport

## About the Project

Visualizing Counter Strike Esports is an attempt to give both players of the game and fans the ability to engage with and understand the complexity of factors influencing matches between the best teams and players in the world. Using our website, users can...
* Use the Head to Head match predictor to see how teams from the top 30 compare
* Use the Player Stats page to take a more indepth look at players from the top 30 teams
* Use the More Info page to learn how to navigate and use the website

### Built Using

Throughout development of this project we did not use any external libraries and only relied on developing using Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will be hosted on Github Pages.

## Usage

To view and use our project, please visit our [website](https://el-afro.github.io/). Upon visiting the website you will land on the Head to Head match predictor. It defaults to displaying the two best teams in the world. Users can choose to either change the teams using the drop down menu or begin the head to head analysis by clicking the arrows on the right and left hand side of the screen.

There are 5 phases of the head to head predictor. In each phase, the two selected teams will be compared using a criteria ranging from ranking in the top 30, to which team has the better players on average. Users will be able to see in real time how these two teams stack up.

After going through all 5 phases the player will be presented with our prediction of who would win in this head to head match up. Players can then decided to either return to one of the previous phases to view one of the criteria again or select two different teams and start over.

If a user would instead like to view player statistics instead of team comparisons, users can navigate to the Player Stats page via the navigation bar. Upon arriving at the Player Stats page, users can select a player from the top 30 teams and view three different visualizations that give users a deeper understanding of this specific player.

Finally, there is also a More Info page that users can visit to get an understanding of our motivation for creating this project. There also exists links to allow users to view the GitHub repository, our process book, as well as a demonstration video.

The link to all three can also be found below.
