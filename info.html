                    Our motivation for delving into Counter-Strike Esports stems from our genuine passion for the game, both as players and spectators. 
                    When professional teams competitively engage in the game, the complexity of factors influencing the outcome becomes evident. 
                    This complexity is so significant that analysts are employed to dissect statistics and data, providing viewers with a better 
                    understanding of which team might emerge winners. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three main pages on our website. This one providing explanation of the website and easy access to various links, the second one
                    being the main feature, our Head to Head predictor. The Head to Head predictor allows users to pick two teams from the top 30 of their choice
                    and see in real time how these teams compare in various criteria. After the user steps through the 5 criteria we have chosen we will provide an
                    estimate of who we believe will win if these teams ever faced off in real life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final page titled more stats gives the user the chance to delve deeper into the individual statistics of players from the top 30 teams.
                    Players can select their favorite player and see various statistics.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    With all this being said, we would appreciate you to explore our website and to check out all of our features. Thank you so much.          
                </p>
